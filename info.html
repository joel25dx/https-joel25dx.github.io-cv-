            ABOUT ME
        </h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        I am a motivated and goal-oriented individual with a strong interest in both technology and physical activity.
        In my free time, I dedicate myself to sports and fitness, which has helped me develop discipline and
        persistence. I also have a genuine passion for technology, where I actively explore gaming and computers to
        expand my technical knowledge.
        <br>
        <br>
        I live in Skillingaryd and initially studied in Vaggeryd to become an electrician, which provided me with
        valuable practical and problem-solving skills. I have since chosen to further my education by studying Java
        development at Campus VÃ¤rnamo, where I am currently focusing on buildning my knowledge within software
        development and programming.
